# intermediate-R-Course
The natures eye intermediate R course. 

#Course overview: 
This course will cover the application of R programming for statistical analysis. Participants will be introduced to the concept of the linear model followed by Generalized linear models. Finally, we will be recreating the models presented in the published papers. 

#Prerequisite: 
1.	 Participants should understand the syntax and logic of programming in R. 
2.	 Participants should understand pre-university mathematics and statistics. 
Learning outcomes: 
•	Data cleaning and wrangling using Tidyverse Packages. 
•	Linear model with single and multiple variables. 
•	Generalized linear models.
